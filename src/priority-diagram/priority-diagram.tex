A priority chart is a descriptive diagram which has a certain order,
and where you would like to emphasize that order.

Here, we use one to show a common TeX workflow
from bottom to top. It's done with the smartdiagram package.

Full explanation in Chapter 9, Creating Graphics:
[Building smart diagrams](http://latex-cookbook.net/articles/smart-diagrams/)
