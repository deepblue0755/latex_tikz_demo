:Title: Growing wave decoration

A decoration of a path which evolves with time. 
Options are available for changing the
start amplitude, end amplitude and the wave length.
Furthermore you decide whether it should start as a cosine or sine wave.
The input of the items is also enabled as lists. Thus it regulates it self along the path.
The start size and end size can be switched which gives a decreasing wave.
